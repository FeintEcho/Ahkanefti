# Ahkanefti
A bot for Discord using the [Discordpy](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) framework.

## Overview
This bot is meant to help handle some of the basic functions of running a game while also providing helpful information.
Currently data is being stored in json files that will continue to be fleshed out through web scraping. When the bot is moved to a server instead of being ran locally, the json files will be transfered to a database.
